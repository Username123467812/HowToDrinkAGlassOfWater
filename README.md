# How To Drink A Glass Of Water

## Basic Procedure:
Maneuver your hand to the glass of water. Clasp the glass and lift it in such a way that the hole points upwards (as in the opposite direction from the Earthâ€™s core). Using your hand, move the glass towards your lips and open your mouth. Lightly rest the top/rim of the glass on your bottom lip and slowly begin to tilt the glass so that the hole faces you, continuing to keep the glass on your bottom lip. Once water starts to flow into your mouth at an adequate rate (by personal preference), stop tilting the glass and keep it at the current angle. You should begin tilting the glass in the opposite direction once you feel like it may not be a good idea to continue drinking. Stop the glass once the angle is such that the hole points directly upwards. Move your hand (and the glass) to the point where the glass is overtop a flat surface, ideally the one the glass was sitting on before you used it to drink water. Let go of the glass.

## Case #1: The glass has more than one hole
You should ideally not use this glass for drinking water, but if absolutely necessary you may attempt to position the hole you choose to not drink out of in a place where water will not come out while drinking. Use your best judgement.

## Case #2: The glass has no holes
Again, this would not be an ideal glass to drink water out of. However, you could try to make a hole in the glass. The problem here is that when you damage glass, it cracks and shatters rather than making a clean hole. Theoretically, a small crack could work for drinking water out of. A crack could be added to the glass via a small concentrated amount of force.

## Case #3: There is no glass
The best possible way to drink water in this scenario is to first locate where the water is. It will probably have spilled and dissipated considering you poured it onto a flat surface with no container. To look for water, you can search for areas that are darker than the surrounding area. If this area is moist, then it is wet. You could try to suck the water off the surface it is on, though this is not advisable for health and safety reasons.
Case #4: Someone tries to steal your water
If someone is trying to steal your glass of water, it creates a less-than-ideal situation for drinking said glass of water. Thus, your new objective should be to stop the person. If they already have your water, a surprise attack would be effective yet risky. If you attack the person while they are holding the glass, and the glass (or container of some variety) does not have a lid (see Case #6), the water may spill out. To avoid this outcome, you could theoretically challenge them to a duel. The downside of this decision, besides the amount of skill (and luck) required to successfully win the duel, is the lack of possibilities for guerilla warfare. If organized combat is your strong suit, then a duel is a great pick. Else, you should seek to find a peaceful solution. Possible peaceful solutions include: negotiation, court case, rap battle, etc. Another semi-viable, non-peaceful, and unorganized solution is to vaporize the person with acid.

## Case #5: The glass is not a glass, but a container
As long as the unit of liquid storage that the water is in does not have a lid on it, the instructions for drinking water should be pretty much the same.

## Case #6: The container has a lid
If the container the water is in has a lid, then you will have to open the lid before you drink the water. The easiest way to remove a lid is to grasp it and turn it towards the left (counter-clockwise).
